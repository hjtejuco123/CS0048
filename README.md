## 🐍 What is Python?

Python is a **high-level**, **interpreted**, and **object-oriented** scripting language known for its readability and simplicity. It is commonly used in:

- Web development
- Software development
- Mathematics
- System scripting
- Data analysis and AI

---

## ✨ Key Features of Python

- Object-Oriented
- Beginner-Friendly
- Easy-to-learn syntax
- Extensive standard libraries
- Platform-independent
- Extendable with C/C++
- GUI Support
- Dynamic Typing
- Integrated with DBs and Web

---

## 🧠 Python Applications

- Web applications
- Workflow automation

- Big Data and mathematical operations
- Rapid prototyping and production

---

## 🕰️ History and Versions

- Developed by **Guido van Rossum** in the late 1980s.
- Influenced by languages like ABC, C, Modula-3, and SmallTalk.
- **Python 1.0** – 1994  
- **Python 2.0** – 2000 (last: 2.7.11)  
- **Python 3.0** – 2008 (not backward compatible, latest: 3.8.3+)

---

## ⚙️ Installing Python

Installers available for:

- **Windows**
- **Mac**
- **Linux**

Tools:
- Text Editors: Notepad
- IDEs: Thonny, PyCharm, VS Code

---

## 🔤 Python Syntax Overview

- Uses **indentation** for blocks (no `{}` or `;`)
- Case-sensitive
- Commands end with newline, not `;`

### Control Statements:

- `if`, `else`, `elif`
- `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`
- `try`, `except`, `finally`, `raise`
- `class`, `def`, `with`, `pass`, `yield`

### Expressions:

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `**`
- `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- `and`, `or`, `not`
- `is`, `in`
- `lambda`, `x if c else y`
- `@` (matrix multiplication)
- `:=` (walrus operator)

---

## ✍️ Identifiers and Variables

- Must start with a letter or `_`
- Can contain letters, digits, `_`
- Case-sensitive (`Age` ≠ `age`)
- Dynamically typed

# 🔁 Module 2: Conditional Statements and Loops in Python

> Learn how to make decisions and perform repetitive tasks in Python using conditional statements and loops.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives



---

## ✅ Conditional Statements in Python

Conditional statements allow Python to make decisions and control program flow based on logical conditions.

### 🔹 `if` Statement

Executes a block of code if the condition is true.

```python
num = 3
if num > 0:
    print("Positive number")


# 🔁 Module 2: Conditional Statements and Loops in Python

---

## ✅ Topics Covered

### 🔹 Conditional Statements in Python
- What are Conditional Statements?
- Truthy and Falsy values in Python
- `if` statement
- `if-else` statement
- `if-elif-else` statement
- Nested `if` statements
- Single-line `if` statements

### 🔹 Loops in Python
- Sequential execution vs Repetition
- `while` loop
  - Syntax and flow
  - Use of `else` with `while`
- `for` loop
  - Iteration over sequence
  - Using `range()` with `for`
  - Using `len()` with `for`
  - Use of `else` with `for`
- Nested Loops
- Using `end` in `print()` for formatting loop output

### 🔹 Loop Control Statements
- `break`: Exit a loop early
- `continue`: Skip current iteration
- `pass`: Placeholder statement in loops and functions
